I want my own language.

The language will be pretty, functional, and suppoer cool!

Basic goes like this:
 - typed (but not nazi typed)
 - function oriented
 - process/actor based
 - good if not great support or systems level programming
 - no garbage collection, it should be smart enough to clean up its own mess
  - learn about memory management
   - what is the stack? can the stack be linked list of instructions of where
     how we got here? variables passed on the "stack" can be easily accessible
   - what is the heap?

Types:
 - types are really just a named structure

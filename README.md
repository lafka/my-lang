# My Language

I want my own language. This repo is the journey, iterative notes included,
and the actual source code.

The language will be pretty, functional, and can be described by positive
adjectives!

Basic goes like this:
 - typed (but not nazi typed)
 - function oriented
 - process/actor based
 - good if not great support for systems level programming
 - no garbage collection, it should be smart enough to clean up its own mess
  - learn about memory management
   - what is the stack? can the stack be linked list of instructions of where
     how we got here? variables passed on the "stack" can be easily accessible
   - what is the heap?

Types:
 - types are really just a named structure
 - successive typing
 - mostly inferred


## Aren't #favourite-language# good enought??

No. This is all just a learning experience. Maybe one day it can fulfil the
wettest geek dreams I have but that's not the point at all.
